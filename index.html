                <p>Always Be Learning is a philosphy I strongly believe in.  The software development profession is constantly changing and evolving.  Often times developers become proficient 
                    in a given technology and turn complacent. A complacent software developer can be detrimental to an organization.  These developers, often times refererred to as 'legacy software developers',
                    are the first to reject change and become guarded in sharing their knowledge in fear of being replaced.  Many times throughout my career, I've run into complacent software developers and 
                    the systems they support are often a direct reflection of them.</p>
    
                <p>I made the decision early in my career to not let this happen to myself.  Change is scary, especially at the rapid pace it occurs in the world of IT.  I've found the most effective way to combat this fear is through continuous education.</p>
                
                <p>Since I started my career 15 years ago, I've committed myself to a lifetime of learning. I find that that there is no single perfect way to get information, which has led me down numerous avenues in order to keep learning and building myself 
                    as a software developer.  I find the best way for me to learn and stay focused is in a classroom setting that is facilitated through a lecture followed by an immediate hands-on deep dive into the topic.  
                    Below is a list of degree and certification programs I have pursued that follows the format I just described above:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Masters Degree in Computer Science</li>
                    <li>Graduate Certificate in Enterprise Web Development (JEE)</li>
                    <li>Masters Certificate in IT Project Managment</li>
                    <li>IBM Certified SOA Solution Designer</li>
                    <li>IBM Certified Application Developer</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition to the above degrees and certifications, I've attended a number of conferences where I've listened to and shared stories with industry professionals.  Some of these conferences/meetups include: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>AWS re:Invent</li>
                    <li>IBM Impact</li>
                    <li>Enterprise Data World</li>
                    <li>JavaOne</li>
                    <li>SpringOne Platform</li>
                    <li>Mark Richards: Software Architecture Conference</li>
                    <li>AWS Portsmouth Meetup</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Lastly, there is a plethera of online resources that I constantly reference. These resources include, but are not limited to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Udemy</li>
                    <li>Pluralsight</li>
                    <li>InfoQ</li>
                    <li>ThoughtWorks</li>
                    <li>Safari Books Online</li>
                    <li>Medium</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My latest educational endeavor has led me to building this website.  For the last 10 years of my career I've been very focused on backend Java development.  I've taken a particular interest in Cloud-based technologies, along with Service Oriented, Service-based and Microservice architectures at enterprise scale. 
                    While focusing on this, I've neglected a lot of changes that have taken place with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition to that, back-end JavaScript runtimes like Node.js have grown in popularity and are being widely adopted by Fortune 100 companies.</p>

                <p>
                    With that said, this year I have decided to address this gap and have enrolled in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, leveraging the MERN stack, at the University of New Hampshire. I'm excited to learn and add this skillset to my software development toolbox and share my learnings with the teams 
                    I'm aligned to at Liberty Mutual.</p>

                <p>
                    Keeping current with the latest technologies and trends has truely motivated and inspired me to better myself as a software developer and gives me the confidence to not only accept change, but to embrace it.</p>
